# web_php
A PHP and Mysql e-commerce.

To set this web, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.</br>
Next run "your localhost root + /web_php/shared/install.php" to create the database and install it.</br>
The admin user which I have made has an email id admin and the password is admin.</br>
Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.(localhost/web_php/public/index.php) is the main page.</br>
